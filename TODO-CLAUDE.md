# Minigun Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

Minigun is a high-performance data processing pipeline framework for Ruby with support
for threads, COW forks, and IPC forks. This document outlines a comprehensive enhancement
plan based on the current codebase state and TODOS.md.

## Enhancement Roadmap

### 0.1: Preview Readiness

- [ ] Docs - mine the tmp/cursor-docs-cleanup folder for more ideas.
- [ ] Cleanup accumulator vs. batch
- [ ] thread/threads, fiber/fibers etc. as alias to pool methods if they don't exist on parent
- [ ] Hooks
- [ ] Config
- [ ] Ractors on Ruby 3.5
- [ ] Minigun global configs
- [ ] Auto-config: # forks should match # of cores
- [ ] Sort-out pipeline inheritance (https://github.com/minigun-org/minigun/pull/4)
- [ ] Remove processor alias?
- [ ] Example runner context
- [ ] Fix JRuby/Mac/etc.
- [ ] Consider what concurrent-ruby abstractions we can use.
- [ ] Docs - Cleanup examples
- [ ] Docs - Review and fix all docs
- [ ] Rubocop final pass

### 0.2 Error Handling & Reliability

- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Handling**
  - Define error handling strategy for each executor type
  - Implement retry mechanisms with backoff
  - Add circuit breaker patterns for failing stages
  - Handle errors in hooks properly

- [ ] **Process Management**
  - Signal trapping for graceful shutdown
  - Child process state management
  - Child process culling (reference Puma's implementation)
  - Supervision tree for processes
  - Wait for last forked process to finish properly

### Phase 1.0: Cross-Boundary Routing

- [x] **Cross-Boundary Routing** ✓ (Completed 2025-01-04)
  - [x] Remove "skip" from hanging example tests
  - [x] IPC fork getting input via `to` from various sources (IPC, COW, threads, master)
  - [x] IPC fork doing output routing
  - [x] IPC to COW, COW to IPC, IPC to master routing
  - [x] IPC/COW fan-out/fan-in patterns
  - Routing patterns
    - [x] output.to of IpcQueues - implemented via IpcRoutedOutputQueue
    - [x] cow_fork getting IPC input via to from IPC
    - [x] cow_fork getting IPC input via to from COW
    - [x] cow_fork getting IPC input via to from threads
    - [x] cow_fork getting IPC input via to from master
    - [x] cow_fork doing IPC output - COW now uses IpcOutputQueue
    - [x] ipc 2 cow, cow to ipc, ipc to master - all working
    - [x] ipc/cow fan-out/fan-in - examples 80, 81, 82, 84 working
    - [ ] routing to inner stages of pipelines
    - [ ] routing to inner stages of cow and ipc fork via an ingress delegator
  - Additional scenarios
    - [ ] test reroute with IPC/COW complex scenarios, inner routing, etc. - all tests passing
    - [ ] producers inside IPC/COW forks
    - [ ] routing with multiple forked processes - round-robin via IPC workers
    - [ ] start of IPC/COW stage should not require await - added await: true option
  - [X] :worker_finished event seems like it should not work like it does. It resends back into the master... hmmm
  - [ ] cleanup pipeline, etc constructor args
  - [ ] wait_for_first_item implmentation look wonky
  - [ ] make StageContext and actual class
  - [ ] Transmit stats across forks
  - [ ] Transmit logs across forks--look at Puma
  - [ ] Support MINIGUN_LOG_LEVEL var

### Phase 1.01: HUD

- [X] Initial HUD work:
  - [X] make a HUD inspired by htop to run as part of CLI
  - [X] two columns:
    - [X] LHS: flow diagram (ascii) on the other side, with ascii flow animations. make it inspired by cyberpunk (blade-runner/matrix/hackers)
    - [X] RHS: list of processes on one side
  - [X] use keys to navigate the hud.
  - [X] use ascii colors
  - [X] Before doing anything, plan it all out.

- [X] Running hud
  - [X] task.hud to run in IRB/Rails console
  - [ ] Test task.hud to run in rake

- [ ] Add hud to all examples when running
  - [ ] Add idiomatic representation for each example

- [ ] HUD UI improvement
  - [X] Introduce Hud::DiagramStage
  - [X] Re-add throughput and bottleneck icons to stages
  - [X] Improve animations, use 24-frame counter (or just int counter which rolls over?)
  - [X] Stagger each connections starting animation frame
  - [ ] Terminal resize doesn't work on windows
  - [ ] Mouse cursor events?
  - [ ] Stage box color to gray when finished
  - [ ] Round-robin vs. fanout animations

  - [ ] DiagramLayoutBuilder to its own class?
  - [ ] Add DiagramPipeline/Executor
  - [ ] Add IPC stages thick/yellow connections
  - [ ] Add ractor, threadcount, etc.
  - [ ] connection length should account for frame size
  - [ ] Arrows on lines?
  - [ ] fix up/down of stages (not clearing lines)

### Phase 1.1: QoL Improvements

- [ ] **Graceful shutdown**
  - [ ] signal trapping, child state management/killing
  - [ ] Kill child threads/forks/ractors
  - [ ] Ctrl+C once to start graceful shutdown (send end signals from all producers)
  - [ ] Press Ctrl+C again to force quit.

- [ ] to_mermaid
- [ ] child culling (look at puma)
- [ ] supervision tree of processes
- [ ] htop-like monitoring dashboard (CLI)
- [ ] Interactive examples in web docs
- [ ] ASCII art drawing of tree

- [ ] Add process supervision tree?

- [ ] **IPC Reliability**
  - Address potential reliability issues with IPC
  - Add timeout handling
  - Handle pipe failures gracefully
  - Stats reporting back to parent process via IPC

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Priorities

1. **Unit Tests**
   - [ ] Stats tracking for all stage types
   - [ ] All executor types
   - [ ] Hook execution and propagation
   - [ ] Signal handling
   - [ ] Error propagation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - [ ] Cross-pipeline routing scenarios
   - [ ] Complex DAG topologies
   - [ ] All executor combinations
   - [ ] Graceful shutdown scenarios

3. **Example Tests**
   - [ ] All examples in `/examples` should have specs
   - [ ] Examples should demonstrate best practices
   - [ ] Extract more real-world use cases

## Breaking Changes to Consider

### Potential Breaking Changes (Discuss with users first)

1. **Stage Names**: Already completed (name as first arg)
2. **Executor Naming**: Consider renaming for clarity
   - `threaded` → `spawn_threads`?
   - `fork_accumulate` → `spawn_forks`?
   - `ractor_accumulate` → `spawn_ractors`?
3. **Signal System**: New signal classes may change APIs
4. **Hook System**: New hook names may conflict

## Implementation Priority

### Quarter 1: Stability
1. Stage to Worker refactoring
2. Signal system cleanup
3. Error handling improvements
4. Process management

### Quarter 2: Features
1. Batch operators
2. Fiber support
3. Configuration system
4. Hook system completion

### Quarter 3: Developer Experience
1. Documentation updates
2. Monitoring dashboard
3. Mermaid diagram generation
4. More examples

### Quarter 4: Polish
1. Dynamic scaling
2. Advanced routing
3. Performance optimizations
4. API stabilization for 1.0

## Open Questions

1. **Naming**: What should the gem be called?
   - Current: minigun
   - Alternatives: nordstream, permian (from todos)

2. **Execution Context**: Should execution contexts be implicit or explicit?
   - Risk of conflicts with base context

3. **Pipeline Locking**: Should running pipelines be immutable?
   - Pro: Safety, no race conditions
   - Con: Less flexibility for dynamic scenarios

4. **Stats Overhead**: Should stats be opt-in or opt-out?
   - Consider performance-critical scenarios

5. **Cross-Executor Routing**: How to handle IPC/COW/thread boundaries?
   - Serialization requirements
   - Performance implications

## Notes from TODOS.md

### Suss Code to Review

```ruby
# From TODOS.md - marked as suspicious
def execute(context, item: nil, _input_queue: nil, output_queue: nil)
  return unless @block
  context.instance_exec(item, output_queue, &@block)
end
```

This method should be reviewed for:
- Safety of instance_exec
- Parameter naming consistency
- Error handling

### Registry Pattern

```ruby
# From TODOS.md - registry registration pattern
pipeline_name = @pipeline.is_a?(Pipeline) ? @pipeline.name : nil
task.registry.register(self, pipeline_name: pipeline_name)
```

This pattern is already implemented but may need review.
